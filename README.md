## 📦 Installation

```
npm install @andrewbrennanfr/wave
```

## 💡 Overview

Wave is a type-safe tool for state management, that automatically handles data
caching, optimistic updating, loading states & error handling. This is achieved
by enforcing a structure for application state, that always accurately reflects
the data's original source of truth (usually an API).

Although originally built to be used with Vue, Wave is not dependent on any
framework & can be integrated with existing state management tools quite easily.
